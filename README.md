# Angular-Faceted-Search

## Overview

**Angular Faceted Search** refers to a faceted search UI pattern implemented in Angular, allowing users to filter data using multiple categories or attributes—like brand, price, rating, etc.—commonly seen in e-commerce and data-heavy applications.

## What is Faceted Search?
Faceted search lets users narrow down results by applying multiple filters across different dimensions. For example:
- Category: Electronics, Clothing, Books
- Brand: Apple, Samsung, Sony
- Price Range: ₹0–₹5,000, ₹5,000–₹10,000
- Ratings: 4 stars & up, 3 stars & up
This pattern improves usability and precision in search-heavy interfaces.
